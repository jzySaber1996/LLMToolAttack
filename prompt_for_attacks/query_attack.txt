The LLM agent uses the support knowledge to help analyze the question and respond to the feedback.
I need you to guess what "support_knowledge" is used in the current reasoning step, i.e., "current_reasoning".
The concept "previous_reasoning" means the reasoning steps before the current reasoning step.
The concept "following_reasoning" means the reasoning steps after the current reasoning step.
You need to guess and generate the "support_knowledge" in the "current_reasoning", and output the results without any other information.
The input is:

{
"previous_reasoning": "",
"following_reasoning": "+ Step 2: {"Observation": "Arthur's Magazine was published from 1844 to 1846, while First for Women started in 1989.", "Thought": "Since Arthur's Magazine started in the 1840s and First for Women started in 1989, Arthur's Magazine clearly started first.", "Action": "Conclude that Arthur's Magazine was started before First for Women.", "Support_Knowledge": ["Arthur's Magazine (1844\u20131846) was an American literary periodical published in Philadelphia in the 19th century.", "First for Women is a woman's magazine published by Bauer Media Group in the USA."]}",
"current_reasoning": "{'Observation': "The query asks to compare the starting dates of two magazines: Arthur's Magazine and First for Women.", 'Thought': 'I need to find out the starting dates of both magazines to determine which one started first.', 'Action': 'Look for the background knowledge that contains information about the starting dates of these magazines.'}",
"question": "Which magazine was started first Arthur's Magazine or First for Women?",
"answer": "Arthur's Magazine"
