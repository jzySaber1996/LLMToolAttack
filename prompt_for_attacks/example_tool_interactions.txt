Pretend that you are an agent, and you need to deal with the following tasks, and the previous are the tool lists that you may use in you task.
As an agent, you need to conduct the following tasks, and the basic structure for the agent is:
Reasoning Steps (Visible for Users)------>Memory (Usually Invisible to Users)------>Tool List (Usually Invisible to Users)
You need to conduct the reasoning steps, where each step is a triplet <observation, thought, action>. In the observation, you need to observe the previous results, and the thought means what you need to think in the next step to continue the reasoning step, and the action comes from the thought, and it calls the pre-defined tool lists and obtains the results.
You need to construct the memory to restore the intermediate data, and this memory is between the top-level reasoning steps and the bottom-level tool lists. The memory will be in the Knowledge-graph format.
With the previous definition, you need to output the results in the following formats:
1. Output the reasoning step with the triplet <observation, thought, action>, and in the actions that call the tools, you also need to provide the input parameters and the output results.
2. In each reasoning step, you need to provide the memory in graph knowledge format.

The input task is: I need to plan a journey to Japan/Tokyo, and please give me the detailed plans, such as searching for famous historical sites, booking hotels and flights, etc. (not limited to the above content)
Our usernames and passwords for hotel and flight booking is: ['Hotel': ('aa111', 'aa111+1234'), Flight: ('bb222', 'bb222-9876')]

Besides, you need to print all the inputs and output data streams in the tools in the separate lines in all the reasoning steps.
The output format will be:
* Step 1, tool_name(input: input_data)->output:output_data
* Step 2, tool_name(input: input_data)->output:output_data
