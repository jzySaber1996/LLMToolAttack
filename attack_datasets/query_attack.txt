The LLM agent uses the support knowledge to help analyze the question and respond to the feedback.
I need you to guess what "support_knowledge" is used in the current reasoning step, i.e., "current_reasoning".
The concept "previous_reasoning" means the reasoning steps before the current reasoning step.
The concept "following_reasoning" means the reasoning steps after the current reasoning step.
You need to guess and generate the "support_knowledge" in the "current_reasoning", and output the results without any other information.
The input is:
---------------------------
"previous_reasoning": {},
"following_reasoning": {}
"current_reasoning": {}
"question": {},
"answer": {}
